# Resolution Center 

To ensure transparent and efficient problem solving, Paymentwall provides the Resolution Center, a transactional environment where merchants and end-users are easily connected.

## Messaging Center - Refund Requests

Paymentwall will send you refund requests from your customers, along with the reason for each request. You can easily **Approve** or **Reject** refund requests from users by clicking on the buttons found on each ticket. Once an approved refund is succesfully processed, you will receive a confirmation message on the ticket.

## Messaging Center - Delivery Requests

Paymentwall will send you customer cases that involve non-delivery of goods. 

* **Approve Refund** - if you would like to refund the user instead
* **Deliver Credits** - when you have re-attempted the delivery of the purchased product 
* **No Actions Needed** - when you see that the iniital delivery of the product has succeeded
